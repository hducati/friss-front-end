# How to run the project

* Install dependencies by using `yarn`
* Start the project with: `yarn start`
* Access your local environment: http://localhost:3000/

## Project

* Instead of using Vue, I have decided to use React. First I started using Vue, but
since I never used Vue before, it would take me some time to learn how to use it and to implement in the application. But I'm really willing to learn Vue and would like to know more about it.

* For testing purpose, I'm using `react-testing-library` and `jest`.

* To mock HTTP requests, I decided to use `axios-mock-adapter`

* I decided to use a CSS-in-JS solution, and for that, I'm using `styled-components`. I really like to work with this kind of solution because it provides me a good flexibility to work with dynamic properties and remove styles specificity.


## Testing

* Run all the tests: `yarn test:all`
* Run and watch changes in the tests: `yarn test`
